# ðŸš¨ Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that detects potential security threats and anomalous network activity. It uses supervised learning techniques to classify network behavior as either normal or intrusive. The model was trained and built from scratch using real-world network traffic datasets.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Detect unauthorized or malicious activity in a network using ML algorithms.
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training â†’ Evaluation â†’ Deployment-ready model.
- **Status:** âœ… Completed (Model Trained) and you can save it just running the code

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The model was trained on a publicly available intrusion detection dataset:

- **Dataset Used:** NSL-KDD
- **Features:** Includes protocol type, service, flag, source bytes, destination bytes, and various traffic-related statistics.
- **Target:** Binary or Multi-class classification for different types of network attacks.
